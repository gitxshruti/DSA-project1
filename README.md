Project Description: Sudoku Solver
Overview
The Sudoku Solver project is a web-based application designed to solve Sudoku puzzles efficiently. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application leverages the backtracking algorithm to provide solutions for any valid Sudoku puzzle input by the user. The project aims to combine functionality with an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing user interface.

Features
-Interactive Interface: Users can input Sudoku puzzles directly into a web-based grid.
-Instant Solving: Utilizes the backtracking algorithm to quickly and accurately solve puzzles.
-User-Friendly Design: Responsive layout and clean design to enhance user experience.
-Validation: Checks for the validity of user input to ensure the puzzle can be solved.
-Clear and Reset Options: Easily clear the grid or reset to the original puzzle state.
Technologies Used
-HTML: Structuring the web page and creating the Sudoku grid.
-CSS: Styling the application to make it visually appealing and responsive.
-JavaScript: Implementing the backtracking algorithm and handling user interactions.
-Algorithm: Backtracking
-The backtracking algorithm is a depth-first search approach used to solve constraint satisfaction problems like Sudoku. It works by trying to place a number in a cell and then recursively attempting to place numbers in subsequent cells. If a conflict is found, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different number, ensuring all possibilities are explored until a solution is found or determined impossible.

User Interface
Grid Input: A 9x9 grid where users can enter the initial Sudoku puzzle.
Solve Button: A button to trigger the backtracking algorithm and solve the puzzle.
Clear Button: Clears the current input for a fresh start.
Reset Button: Resets the grid to the initial state provided by the user.
Usage
Input Puzzle: Enter the known numbers of the Sudoku puzzle into the grid.
Solve: Click the "Solve" button to let the backtracking algorithm find the solution.
Clear/Reset: Use the "Clear" button to clear the grid or the "Reset" button to revert to the initial puzzle state.
Future Enhancements
Difficulty Levels: Pre-defined puzzles of varying difficulty.
Hint System: Provide hints to users for solving the puzzle manually.
Mobile Optimization: Enhance usability on mobile devices.
This Sudoku Solver project not only demonstrates the power of the backtracking algorithm but also showcases the seamless integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a functional and attractive web application.
